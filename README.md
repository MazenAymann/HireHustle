# HireHustle

Cairo University Graduation Project which received an outstanding A+ grade and positive feedback from project mentors and academic faculty for the innovative approach and practical implementation of the system.
HireHustle is an applicant tracking system that helps HR in recruitment processes by using Artificial Intelligence (Semantic Similarity) that should take CVs and should rank them based on the intended job post.
We developed 2 mobile applications, 1 for HR and the other for the applicant, a backend for both applications and we developed a web application for admin panel.

# Project Components
- Mobile Applications (Frontend: Flutter)

  - Applicant App: Allows job seekers to upload and manage their CVs, search for job postings, and track application status.
  - HR App: Enables HR professionals to post job vacancies, review ranked CVs, and manage the recruitment process.
  
- Backend (Spring Boot)

  - Powers both mobile applications and the web application, handling data processing, AI algorithms for CV ranking, and system integration.
- Web Application (Admin Panel)

  - Provides administrators with tools to oversee the entire system, manage users, and generate reports.
# Features
- AI-Driven CV Ranking: Uses semantic similarity to match CVs with job descriptions.
- User-Friendly Interfaces: Developed with Flutter for a seamless experience on both HR and Applicant apps.
- Robust Backend: Built with Spring Boot to ensure reliable performance and scalability.
- Comprehensive Admin Tools: Web application for system administration and reporting.
# Technologies Used
